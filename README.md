# Setting Up Environment:

In order to run the benchmark, you need
1. The AGAR benchmark image library. You can download it [from their site](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/agar), or you can use the demo images in the zip file.
2. [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git). It is easiest to just clone it into this directory with > "git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git". If running the C++ benchmark, follow [these directions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-opencv-in-c-on-linux/#) to install opencv locally, for example on WSL2. It takes a while, wish there was a way to only use parts of it
