# Setting Up Environment:

In order to run the benchmark, you need
1. The AGAR benchmark image library. You can download it [from their site](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/agar), or you can use the demo images in the zip file.
2. [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git). It is easiest to just clone it into this directory with > "git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git". The git ignore will prevent it from being uploaded to this repo.
